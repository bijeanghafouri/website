abstract: This  study  aims  at  understanding  how  persuasion  effects  are  used  to  solicit  campaign contributions.   Campaign  contributions  take  an  essential  role  in  elections,  and  often  are  akey  factor  in  deciding  the  outcome.   However,  research  is  scarce  insofar  as  measuring  the effectiveness of techniques used on the ground. Specifically, I seek to study the effectiveness of  social  pressure  in  email  solicitation  by  the  use  of  nudging,  one  of  the  most  commonly used  techniques  to  alter  behavior.   To  do  so,  I  run  two  survey  experiments  and  one  field experiment  partnering  with  a  municipal  political  party  in  Canada.   Preliminary  analyses demonstrate that using social pressure in a message can increase the probability of donating by  9  percentage  points.   These  results  are  especially  interesting  given  the  low  cost  of  the treatment.  Simply by formulating messages differently, political parties can drastically improve their chances of winning an election.

This  study  aims  at  understanding  how  persuasion  effects  are  used  to  solicit  campaign contributions.   Campaign  contributions  take  an  essential  role  in  elections,  and  often  are  a key  factor  in  deciding  the  outcome.   However,  research  is  scarce  insofar  as  measuring  the effectiveness of techniques used on the ground. Specifically, I seek to study the effectiveness of  social  pressure  in  email  solicitation  by  the  use  of  nudging,  one  of  the  most  commonly used  techniques  to  alter  behavior.   To  do  so,  I  run  two  survey  experiments  and  one  field experiment  partnering  with  a  municipal  political  party  in  Canada.   Preliminary  analyses demonstrate that using social pressure in a message can increase the probability of donating by  9  percentage  points.
