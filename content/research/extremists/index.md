abstract: Do politicians set the agenda during campaigns?  Do politicians make voters extremists, or do extreme voters make politicians extreme?  Past research has offered an explanation to the agenda setting process during campaigns.  This theoretical suggestion consist of voters blindly following the views of their preferred politician.  However, past research is short of situating the origin of politicians’ views.  In this study, I formulate the Downstream extremism theory, a novel explanation to why past theories offer an incomplete explanation to the agenda-setting process during campaigns. I argue that political elites take cues from extremist voters, who then give cues to moderate voters.  Electoral campaigns are the mechanism by which politicians receive feedback from extremists. To empirically demonstrate this, I use the case of the 2020 US Presidential debate.  By taking advantage of the randomness of the content of the debate, I am able to causally estimate the effect of the debate on the expressed sentiment  of  Twitter  users.   My  findings  confirm  my  expectation  that  extremists  respond more to campaigns than moderates.

Do politicians set the agenda during campaigns?  Do politicians make voters extremists, or do extreme voters make politicians extreme?  Past research has offered an explanation to the agenda setting process during campaigns.  This theoretical suggestion consist of voters blindly following the views of their preferred politician.  However, past research is short of situating the origin of politicians’ views.  In this study, I formulate the Downstream extremism theory, a novel explanation to why past theories offer an incomplete explanation to the agenda-setting process during campaigns. I argue that political elites take cues from extremist voters, who then give cues to moderate voters.  Electoral campaigns are the mechanism by which politicians receive feedback from extremists. To empirically demonstrate this, I use the case of the 2020 US Presidential debate.  By taking advantage of the randomness of the content of the debate, I am able to causally estimate the effect of the debate on the expressed sentiment  of  Twitter  users.
